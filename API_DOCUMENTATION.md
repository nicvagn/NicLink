# NicLink Python API to EasyLink SDK

> WARN: not guarinteed to be up to date

    The main gateway that you will interact with is a class called NicLinkManeger

    it takes one required param ( refresh delay ) and one optional ( logger )

nl_interface(the connection w physical board, usb or bluetoth):

```

 * connect does not return the chess ptr, but stores it in the cpp memory.
 * This should be called before any other functions that use chess ptr.
 * ======================================*/

m.def("disconnect", &disconnect, "disconnect from the chessboard.");

// switch modes
