# things I have learned about chessnut:

    ```cpp
    chessLink -> switchUploadMode();
    ```

    - is not required to turn on LED's or make beep. I think it is for uploading games to
      the internal memory

## use with gnu/linux:

    see READ.md, you have to use a udev rule in order to use the chessboard.
